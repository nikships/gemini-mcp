## Prompt fundamentals

Your prompt can be a short phrase:

```
A folk song about cute cats avoiding puddles, female vocals, acoustic guitar, sound of rain
```

Or a structured, detailed description:

```
A 1980s-style synth-pop track with a driving beat, shimmering synthesizers, and a catchy, anthemic chorus. The song should have a retro-futuristic feel with modern production polish. Upbeat tempo around 120 BPM, clear verse-chorus structure, and a memorable instrumental hook. The lyrics describe getting ready for a party.
```

Both short and detailed prompts produce strong results. Use the following strategies to guide the model toward the exact sound you want.

## Genre and style

Lead your prompt with the primary genre. You can combine genres to create unique hybrids:

- A fusion of metal and hip-hop
- Death metal combined with operatic vocals
- Classical chamber music with dark electronic drone elements
- Modern electronic dance music (EDM) mixed with Europop

You can also specify a musical era or regional variant:

- Early 1990s boom-bap hip-hop
- 1960s French yé-yé pop
- 1980s post-punk and new wave

## Song structure and timing

For Lyria 3.5, define song progression using tags or arrows:

- `[Intro] -> [Verse 1] -> [Chorus] -> [Verse 2] -> [Chorus] -> [Bridge] -> [Outro]`
- Start with a quiet piano intro, build into an energetic verse, pause for a moment of silence, then explode into the chorus.

You can direct energy dynamics and transitions:

- Build tension through the pre-chorus, then drop to silence before an explosive chorus
- Gradual crescendo throughout the song, adding one instrument per section
- A sudden stop after the bridge, followed by an a cappella chorus

You can also prompt specific timing markers:

- Build to a beat drop at 12 seconds
- Vocal sample repeats every 4 bars
- The chorus kicks in at 22 seconds

## Lyrics and vocals

Lyria 3.5 generates vocal tracks with lyrics by default. You can provide your own lyrics, ask the model to generate them, or request an instrumental track.

### Using your own lyrics

Include your lyrics directly in the prompt beneath a `Lyrics:` header. Tag each section to guide vocal delivery:

```
Lyrics:

[Intro]
Ooooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
Early morning rain on the window pane
City lights wash away the pain
Walking down this empty street again

[Chorus]
We keep moving on (moving on)
Until the morning light
Everything will be alright
```

Use parentheses for backing vocals, echoes, or ad-libs, like `(moving on)` .

### Directing generated lyrics

When asking Lyria 3.5 to write lyrics, outline the narrative, emotion, or key phrases:

```
The lyrics describe driving down the Pacific Coast Highway at sunset. The mood is nostalgic and reflective. Include an uplifting, anthemic chorus about second chances and starting over.
```

For electronic and dance genres, request short repeating vocal hooks:

```
An upbeat dance-pop track with a repetitive, high-energy vocal hook: "Feel the rhythm all night long."
```

### Vocal delivery and singer profiles

Specify gender, vocal range, and timbre for precise delivery:

- **Female Soprano** : Clear, crystalline timbre with an agile, soaring delivery. Bright tone capable of airy, breathy textures.
- **Female Alto** : Rich, warm, and husky lower range. Smoky timbre with a soulful, resonant chest voice.
- **Male Tenor** : Bright, piercing, and energetic. Youthful timbre with high belting power that cuts through dense mixes.
- **Male Baritone** : Deep, velvet-smooth chest voice with a warm, soothing, crooning delivery.
- **Weathered Rocker** : Raspy, gritty timbre reminiscent of 1990s alternative rock. Raw emotional intensity with strained upper notes.

### Non-lyrical vocal effects

You can also prompt for spoken dialogue, vocal chops, and sampling effects:

- A vintage radio broadcast voice introduces the song before the beat kicks in
- A spoken voice whispers right before the drop, followed by high-energy synths
- Chopped, pitch-shifted vocal samples looping as an instrumental rhythm element

- **Tempo (BPM)** : Set the tempo directly (e.g. `120 BPM` , `slow tempo around 72 BPM` , `fast 160 BPM` ).
